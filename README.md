# HTML Navigation Module for Kohana 3.3

This Kohana module started out as a fork of the original Kohana Menu module by
[Bastian Br√§u](http://github.com/b263/kohana-menu) with the purpose of simplifying dynamic navigation building, most
notably the issue of

```html
<ul>
	<li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
	<li><a href="/about" class="active">About</a></li>
</ul>
```

Some aspects of the module might not work since they are untested.

## Basics

The menus are defined in configuration files, which must be placed in the `config/menu` folder
(see [config/menu/bootstrap.php](https://github.com/anroots/kohana-menu/blob/master/config/menu/bootstrap.php)).

To render the menu without modifications, call:

```php
<?php
// APPPATH/views/template.php

echo Menu::factory('bootstrap')->render();
// echo (string)Menu::factory()
```

## Installation

1.	Place the files in the modules directory.

### As a Git submodule:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/anroots/kohana-menu.git modules/menu
```
### As a [Composer dependency](http://getcomposer.org)

```javascript
{
	"require": {
		"php": ">=5.4.0",
		"composer/installers": "*",
		"anroots/menu":"2.*"
	}
}
```

2.	Create a folder `menu` in your applications config directory, copy the `menu/bootstrap.php` into it, and adjust it to fit your navigation.

```bash
mkdir -p application/config/menu
cp modules/menu/config/menu/bootstrap.php application/config/menu/bootstrap.php
# edit application/config/menu/bootstrap.php
```

3.	Activate the module in the `bootstrap.php` file.
```php
<?php
Kohana::modules(array(
	...
	'menu' => MODPATH.'menu',
));
```

4. Echo the output in your template
```html
<div class="navbar navbar-fixed-top">
	<div class="navbar-inner">
		<div class="container">
			<?=(string)Menu::factory()?>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

## Config files

You can use different config files by setting the factory's `$config` parameter.

### Example: Load menu configuration based on user role

```php
	$menu = Menu::factory($role); // this could use `config/menu/(user|admin).php`
```

## Marking the current menu item

The config setting `current_class` defines the css class, which will be used by the `set_current()` method, to mark the current menu item:
```php
	$menu->set_current('article/show');
```
The parameter of `set_current()` is the URL value of the respective item or its ID.
